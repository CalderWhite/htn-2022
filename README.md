# Hack the North Frontend Challenge 2022

I code real good, I communicate even better. Pls hire me :)


Ideally the UI should be "intuitive", but from a technical standpoint here are the things to try doing:

 - Logging in as the wrong email
 - Logging in with an invalid email
 - Logging in with the wrong password
 - Pressing enter/escape to submit/exit the login form
 - Resizing the page ;)
 - Clicking on a related event link
 - Opening and closing the days
 - Clicking the link icon
